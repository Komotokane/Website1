Here we decided to make a website for the chester county schools theatre program. 
The reason why is because one of us, Mitchell, is very active in theatre. We both thought they could use a website.
Often times he wouldn't know when they'd be getting together so having an online way to see when they were practicing would help greatly. One thing we knew we wanted was a schedule for when practice was going to happen. 
We also wanted to make sure we added in some way to contact the theatre teacher and whoever was working in the theater program to make it happen. So we knew we also needed contacts.
"About" was pretty much a given along with home because about talk about what the theater program hopes to accomplish.
As for the others it was kind of a stretch. We knew we needed more pages so we decided that the rest were goig to be padding, but we feel like it helped streamline the site in some ways. 
We also wanted to keep things simple and functional, nothing fancy just a website that works. Functionality over appearance as it were.
We we also wanted to make it seem like a stage play at first, but the colors tht were requested so we asked the teacher what they wanted the colors to be. They wanted a white, black and blue color scheme to we abided.

Page, why you made it like it 1-6
