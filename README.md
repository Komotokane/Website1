Here we decided to make a website for the chester county schools theatre program. 
One thing we knew we wanted was a schedule for when practice was going to happen. Since one of us is very active in the theatre program, they would often have trouble knowing when practice was. With a way to check it online, it would help us to know when pratice is.
We also wanted to make sure we added in some way to contact the theatre teacher. So we knew we neaded contacts.
About was prety mcuh a given along with home.
As for the others it was kind of a stretch. We knew we needed more pages so the rest were padding, but we feel like it helped streamline the site
We also wanted to keep things simple and funcitonal, nothing fancy just a website that works. Functionality over appearance as it were.
We we also wanted to make it seem like a stage play at first, but the colors were kinda weird so we asked the teacher what they wanted. They wanted a white black and blue color scheme to we abided.
