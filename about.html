<p>What we provide are performances held by our own students</p>
<p>The Theater Departments at Chester County High School puts on at least two shows a year. Most of the sets and works you see on stage are done by the students.
We even hold some student directed plays during the winter. It allows our students the opportunity to direct their own play. We also enjoy putting on a show for the people of Tennessee and all proceeds go back to the school, in other words going to a play is supporting the school and your kids.</p>

<p>Partnering with Band and Choir well help teach the students how to put on numbers to be able to do it perfectly. The band gets the music just right, choir helps our actors hone their singing voices, and the theatre allows us tobecome our character and stay in our character. These things are all very useful to the shows because it adds off
of one another. We hope you enjoy the shows that we and our students put on, we are all happy to have you as our
audience.</p>
